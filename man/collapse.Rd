\title{ collapses response categories }
\description{
  collapses response categories if cell frequencies are less than the specified
  minimum threshold (i.e., minCell) and returns a vector of recoded values.
}
\usage{
collapse(resp, group, minCell)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{resp}{ a vector of item responses }
  \item{group}{ a vector of group designations }
  \item{minCell}{ a minimum cell frequency }
}
\details{
  Collapses item response categories in resp if the two-way contingency table (resp x group)  
  has cell frequencies less than the minimum cell count threshold specified by minCell.
}
\value{
  a numeric vector of the same length as resp with collapsed/recoded values.

\note{ 
  Item responses are expected to start from 1 not 0 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and not 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
  There must be at least two unique categories after collapsing/recoding.

  collapse(r1,gr,2) #minCell=2
  ## returns  c(1,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,2,2)
  ## response categories 2 and 3 are collapsed
